# CounterCrowdStrike
This DuckyScript, created by ooovenenoso, automates the removal of problematic CrowdStrike files causing BSOD on Windows. The script opens PowerShell as an administrator, sets the execution policy to bypass restrictions, checks for specific CrowdStrike files, deletes them if found, and restarts the computer to complete the fix.
